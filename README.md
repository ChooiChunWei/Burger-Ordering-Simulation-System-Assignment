December 2020 â€“ March 2021<br/><br/>

## System Introduction
This simulation system includes the menu and order features. The main purpose of this assignment is to evaluate the reliability of a system before and after implementing design patterns using defect density and cyclomatic complexity. The Decorator design pattern and State design pattern were applied in this system.
